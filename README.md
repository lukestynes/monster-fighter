# MonsterFighter
## Story
The premise of the game is that you are a monster trainer looking to battle and takeover the city. You must put together a monster team and defeat battles of opposing monsters. There is a shop that you can make use of to buy items and monsters along the way to help yourself win.

## Technologies 
This is a simple GUI monster fighting game created in Java using the Swing UI system.
It uses no other external packages.

## Notes
This entire project was made over the space of 72 hours, so excuse if there's some sloppy code.

Given more time the GUI would have been customised and made to look a lot nicer than it currently does.

*Created as a project submission for SENG201 at University of Canterbury.*
